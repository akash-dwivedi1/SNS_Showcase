Task: We will send a SNS notification (email/sms) when some event occurs. 

We can perform this task by three methods:
1. Cloudwatch Console
2. AWS CLI 
3. Terraform

Cloudwatch in combination with SNS creates a decent monitoring system with notifies the admin in case of any issue in the configuration/environment.
